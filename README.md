## 💡 **Analysis and Insights**

### 🎄 1. Strong Sales Seasonality (Impact: Critical)

**📊 Key Data:**

* Q4 (Oct–Dec): **65% of annual revenue** (£6.3M)
* November: **Peak at £1.5M** (+89% vs October)
* January: **Drop of -35%** compared to December

**🔍 Analysis:**
The “gifts and decoration” positioning creates excessive dependence on the Christmas period. This concentration generates major operational and financial risks.

**💥 Business Impact:**

* ⚠️ Cash flow risk in Q1–Q2 (January–June)
* ⚠️ High financing needs in Q3 to build inventory
* ⚠️ Supply chain pressure in October–November
* ⚠️ Resource underutilization (teams, warehouse) 7 months/year

**✅ Recommendations:**

**Short Term (0–3 months):**

1. Launch a “New Year Resolutions” campaign in January (organization, wellness items)
2. Create a Valentine’s Day collection (Jan 15 – Feb 14)
3. Targeted promotions on non-seasonal items in January (-20%)
4. Promote gift cards after Christmas

**Mid Term (3–12 months):**

1. Develop **4 themed collections**:

   * 🌸 Spring/Easter (March–April)
   * 💒 Wedding/Summer (May–July)
   * 🎃 Back-to-school/Halloween (Sept–Oct)
   * 🎄 Christmas (Nov–Dec)
2. Negotiate supplier payment facilities (spread Q3 → Q1)
3. Loyalty program to retain post-Christmas customers
4. Invest in the “home decoration” segment (less seasonal)

**Long Term (1–3 years):**

1. Diversify product mix: 30% permanent decoration / 70% seasonal
2. Develop B2B offering (hotels, restaurants, offices)
3. International expansion (different seasonal patterns)

**💰 Estimated ROI:** +12% to +18% annual revenue, +25% improved cash flow

  3. JUMBO BAG RED RETROSPOT (£93K)

2. Test +5–10% price increase on best-sellers
3. Automated low-stock alert system
4. Pre-orders 6 months in advance for Top 20

**Marketing & Merchandising:**

1. Premium positioning (homepage, showcases, featured sections)
2. Lifestyle content (videos, inspiration photos, decor ideas)
3. Customer reviews as social proof (rating 4.5+)
4. Targeted ad campaigns (high ROI on best-sellers)

**📊 KPIs to Track:**

* Top 20 stock-out rate (<5%)
* Top 10 share of total revenue
